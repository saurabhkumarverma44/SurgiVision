# SurgiVision
SurgiVision is an end-to-end medical AI system that leverages 3D autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection in spleen CT scans. Our project demonstrates a complete pipeline from raw medical data processing to a deployable web interface. It is designed for identifying pathological conditions in spleen CT scans using deep learning.
